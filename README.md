A Gleam library for adding colours in terminal outputs.

Very important for building beautiful test suites or ncurses terminal apps.

## Quick start

Colours is easy to use. 

Just use any colour you want as a function. For foreground colour add fg and for background color add bg.
for example:

    colours.fgmaroon("Maroon")
 
 will print Maroon in Maroon colour.

    colours.bgmaroon("Maroon")
 
 will print Maroon with Maroon background.
