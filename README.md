A Gleam library for adding colours in terminal outputs.

Very important for building beautiful test suites or ncurses terminal apps.

> Note: Colours working on Gleam 0.15.0 latest main branch 

## Quick start

Colours is easy to use. 

Just use any colour you want as a function. For foreground colour add `fg` and for background color add `bg` 

in front of any colour you want to use from color image.

for example:

    colours.fgmaroon("Maroon")
 
 will print Maroon in Maroon colour.

    colours.bgmaroon("Maroon")
 
 will print Maroon with Maroon background.
